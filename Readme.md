## Abstract 
<!-- An over abundance of wild boar presents an incredible ecological problem for managers. A consistant and growing threat around the globe, wild boar populations have been growing steadily in Europe since the 1980s (Massei, Giovanna, et al.). There are numerous methods for controlling wild boars with the objective of reducing the damage they cause to a lancscape. One method for deterring wild boar is “Wildschwein-Schreck” or "scare-off" methods. In this case it is done by installing speakers to play loud noises in an effort to drive away any wild boars. This study hopes to determine if this method is really effective in keeping boars away by analyzing movement patterns in relation to these speakers -->

## Research Questions
<!-- Can the effectiveness of scare-off methods be determined by analyzing wild boar movement data. Specifically, looking at indivudal and group trajectories before and after scare-off methods are started (speakers being turned on). 
Further more do the boars stay away from the area after a scare-off attempt, and for how long?  -->

## Results / products
<!-- I would anticipate the boars to initally flee once scare-off methods begin, but overtime may become desensitized to the noises until such a point where it is no longer effective. -->

## Data
<!-- Data will be provided by ZHAW's Geoinformatics Research Group, through the course Patterns and trends in environmental data. The data has already been provided through coursework. Data specifically regarding the placement and status (on/off) of the speakers will also be needed. Upon coachign session I will ask if they believe any additional context data is available and approperiate. -->

## Analytical concepts
<!-- After any possible data clean up, I might begin by creating a entity raster based on the timestamps of boar position before and after a scare event is started to determine their position. Then creating vectors to determine if they are indeed fleeing away from the speakers. I'll then analyize the topography of the field area to determine if the boars movements are constrained in anyway in an effort to example any particular unusual movements. I'll be looking at there movement from an Eulerian perspective based on their distance and oreitation from the speakers. -->

## R concepts
<!-- In order to avoid possible confusion and misinterperated results, I will likely stick to those R packages and concepts introduced in class (readr, dplyr, ggplot2, etc). Any suggested spatial analysis from coachs would be highly welcome. -->

## Risk analysis
<!-- The largest challenge facing this project is my own inexperience with R, and lack of knowledge with spatial analysis. That coupled with responsbilities for other courses will make time management paramount. Plan B consists of asking for considerable help from coaches, classmates, and throwing my questions into the void of the internet. -->

## Questions? 
<!-- The scope of how much analysis they think is approperiate, any possible data cleaning they might suggest, common pit falls students in the past have fallen into, how many outside studies should I reference? How to make sure tears don't get on my keyboard when R makes me cry? -->
